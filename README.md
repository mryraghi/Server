# CSCI 440: HTTP Server
by Romeo Bellon

- this little project/assignment can be easily tested here:
    - http://104.131.100.250:8080/index.html // INDEX page
    - http://104.131.100.250:8080/?name=Romeo&surname=Bellon&class=CSCI440 // GET Operation
    - http://104.131.100.250:8080/SimplePost.html // POST Operation
    - http://104.131.100.250:8080/asdafasfsdf // ERROR handling
- the GitHub page for this project/assignment is https://github.com/mryraghi/Server
- this is project made with Clion 1.1.1 but is executable even from the terminal, of course
- I've create a script **autoscript.sh** that helped me to automate the process of updating my local repository from github. It's not necessary to use it, but it is useful.

- This is the best I can do for now :)
